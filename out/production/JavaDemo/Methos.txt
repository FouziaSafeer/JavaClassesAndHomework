Methods in java:
is just a collection of java statements and block of code {cide in this bracets, loops print ln}
Why we should learn method:
    1)it allows us to simply large code as we divide the logic into smallar parts by creating methods from them
    for them build those method one by one later on combine them to build the complete application.
    2.)Methods allows us to reuse code.
    3.)Methods allow us to be flexible(maintainable)if one part is chance only update that.
 how can we creat Methods?
        There are two types 1>built in and 2>user define.
 Built-in methods?
    The methods which are design by java developers e.g println(),nextInt() methods in scanner class.
    lenghth method in string class they are all built in methods.
User define methods:
    the methods that Write.
    Methods which returns something when called and other are methods which do not return anything when called.


 int add(int a,int n)   {
 return a+b;
 }
 int=>>> return type of method.
 add=>>name of method
 (int a, int b)=>> paramether of the method or input of method
{   body of the method
}
Rules:
return type and values that we are returning  from a method should match
we only assign methods



local variable:
if a variable is created inside a block of code like methos,loop,if condition etc....
they are called local variable.
upside:
    local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time ,
    you should always try to write withlocal variable
Downside:
they cannot be accessed outside the block in which they are created. they have very limited scope

instance variable:
All the variables which are created in side a class, outside of methods are called instance variable
upside:
    we can use them in all the instance methods of that class, thier scope is larger then local variable
downside:
they stayed longer in the memory as compare to local variables.


static varibale:
outside method and with static ketword at start is called static variable.
static variable only occupy one memory location from RAM even though we create
1000 objectsof that class.
they can be used in any block of code inside the class they can be accessed in any
methods of the class, they can also be acess with help of that obkject,
most wider scope.
Downside:
they are loaded into the memory when a class is loaded even though you don't use them.


Summary:
In Java, variables can be classified into three types: local, instance, and static.
1.    Local Variables: Local variables are defined inside a method or block of code.
They are only accessible within the method or block of code where they are declared and are not
visible outside of it. They are also known as automatic or stack variables. They do not have a default
 value, so you must initialize them before using them.
2.    Instance Variables: Instance variables are defined in a class but outside of any method.
 They are associated with an instance of the class and have a default value. They can be accessed
 by any method in the class and are also known as non-static fields.
3.    Static Variables: Static variables are also defined in a class but outside of any
method and are shared among all instances of the class. They are associated with the class itself
 rather than any specific instance. They can be accessed by any method in the class and are also known
  as class variables. They have a default value and can be accessed directly by calling className.variableName.
